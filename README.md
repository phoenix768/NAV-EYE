# üí† Getting Started

> Note: Complete the [Set Up Your Environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) guide before proceeding.
## üì¶ Install Dependencies
```sh
#IN root directory
npm install
```
```sh
cd backend
npm install
```
```sh
cd backend/api-rail
npm install
```
## üîß Environment Configuration

> Important: Create the following two .env files

>Use your local IP address instead of localhost. Example: 192.163.8.2 (find it using ipconfig on Windows or ifconfig on Mac/Linux).

#### üìÑ Root  `.env` - For your IP Address
```sh
IP_ADDRESS=your_ip_address
```
#### üìÑ `backend/.env` ‚Äì For the GraphQL API Server
```sh
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key
```

## üîê Backend Setup
> Important: This app uses two separate servers to function fully.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ server.js ‚Äì GraphQL API Server
```sh
cd backend
node server.js
```

- Handles GraphQL queries  
- Integrates with Google Maps API  

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ api-rail/app.js ‚Äì Express API Server for Train Info
```sh
cd backend/api-rail
node app.js
```
- Provides RESTful endpoints for:
  - Train routes
  - Live status
  - Schedules
  - PNR status  
- Uses scraping and external data sources  

Both servers must be running concurrently for the app to work properly.
## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Start Metro

```sh
# Using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```
